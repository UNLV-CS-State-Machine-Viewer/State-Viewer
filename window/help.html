                <h2>
                * To get started, you will need to drag/drop (upload) an XML model file of a State Machine.
                <br>* After the file is uploaded, the block diagram will initiate.                         

                </h2>

                <h3>
                <br><u>Page Layout</u>
                </h3>
                <img src="pageLayout.png" width="650 height=auto">

                <h2><br>There are three main sections to interact with on the page.
                Each section is described in detail below.</h2>

                <h3><u>1. Select an Event:</u></h3> 
                The events and guards provided in the XML file become buttons that the user can press
                to send the event. <br>The guard buttons are check boxes to set to true and false.
                <br>The color of the guard turns green when selected to indicate true. The unchecked box
                will default to red to indicate the guard is not set. 
                
                <h3><u>2. Block Window:</u></h3> 
                The diagram represents a model of the system with its corresponding states and transitions. 
                The active state will be highlighted along with the path that that it took to get there.

                <h3><u>3. Results:</u></h3> 
                This is text log viewer that will update just as the block window updates to record the history of the state machine.

                <h2><u><br>FAQs:</u></h2>

                <h4>What file types are supported and where are they generated from? </h4>
                <p class="helpIndent"> The XML model file comes from a UML Statechart Modeling Tool. 
                    <br>A Computer Aided Software Engineering Tool (CASE) is used to enter UML Statechart
                    designs and generate a readable XML file with graphics information in it. </p>
                    <p class="helpIndent"> We recommend to use a .qm file generated from the QM Model-Based Design Tool. </p>
